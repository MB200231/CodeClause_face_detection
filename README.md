# CodeClause_face_detection

A face detection web development project typically involves utilizing computer vision algorithms and libraries to detect and analyze human faces in images or real-time video streams. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started on your face detection web development project:

Set up your development environment
Install a web server.
Set up a code editor.

Choose a face detection library or API:
I have used various types API models such as :
1.face_landmark_68_tiny_model-shard1
2.face_landmark_68_model-shard1
3.face_expression_model-shard1
4.tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
5.face_recognition_model-shard2
6.face_recognition_model-shard1

Select a programming language:
JavaScript: Suitable for web-based applications and utilizing cloud-based APIs.

Set up your project structure:
Create a directory structure for your project, including folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code.
Install any necessary dependencies, such as the chosen face detection library or API SDK.

Develop the front-end:
Create an HTML file with appropriate markup for the user interface.
Use CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing.
Write JavaScript code to handle user interactions, capture images from the camera, and display the detected faces.

Implement face detection:
Depending on the chosen library or API, refer to its documentation for instructions on face detection implementation.
Write the necessary code to process images or video frames and detect faces.
You may need to resize, crop, or preprocess the images before passing them to the face detection algorithm.

Display the results:
Once faces are detected, you can draw bounding boxes around them or overlay other graphical elements to highlight the faces.
You might also want to display additional information or perform further analysis, such as gender recognition or emotion detection.
